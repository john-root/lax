This correction is already present in the signal that ganglion cells send from the retina but the biophysical mechanisms underlying this computation are not known. Here we demonstrate that motion anticipation is computed autonomously within the dendritic tree of each ganglion cell and relies on feedforward inhibition. The passive and non-linear interaction of excitatory and inhibitory synapses enables the somatic voltage to encode the actual position of a moving object instead of its delayed representation. General rather than specific features of the retinal connectome govern this computation: an excess of inhibitory inputs over excitatory, with both being randomly distributed, allows tracking of all directions of motion, while the average distance between inputs determines the object velocities that can be compensated for.",

This \u2018retinotopic map\u2019 is preserved through the visual pathway and is used to guide behaviour (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Malpeli and Baker, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bonin et al., 2011</a>). There is, however, a problem to overcome when this map is used to estimate the position of a moving object: the slow speed with which photoreceptors convert light into an electrical signal causes RGCs to respond \u223c70 ms after an object first appears (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baylor and Hodgkin, 1974</a>). During this delay, a tennis ball served by a professional player will have travelled \u223c3\u20134 m. The fact that the position of the ball can be estimated precisely enough to meet it with a racquet demonstrates that the visual system is able to overcome the phototransduction delay for moving stimuli. Together, these computations are termed motion anticipation, and they begin in the inner retina (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berry et al., 1999</a>): when a stimulus is moving, the peak-firing rate of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) occurs earlier than expected from the delayed response to a flashed stimulus. This correction supports accurate target tracking in salamander (<a href=\"#bib45\">Leonardo and Meister, 2013</a>).",

One aspect of motion processing that is understood in detail is the generation of directionally selective responses peculiar to a small subset of RGCs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Borst and Euler, 2011</a>). Analysis of neuronal connectivity using large-scale electron microscopy has demonstrated that this computation involves asymmetric connections with a specific type of inhibitory interneuron, the starburst amacrine cell (<a href=\"#bib12\">Briggman et al., 2011</a>), which has dendrites that are themselves directionally selective (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hausselt et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yonehara et al., 2013</a>). Motion anticipation appears to be a more fundamental retinal computation than directional selectivity because it is observed in the large majority of ganglion cells, of different functional types and across many species (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berry et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Schwartz et al., 2007</a>). We do not understand how the retina generates motion anticipation, but the ubiquity of this process across ganglion cell types suggests that it reflects general properties of the inner retinal circuit rather than the specific wiring of subtypes of neuron. A fast decrease in the gain with which signals are transmitted through the retina has been proposed to account for motion anticipation, but the site(s) of such control have not been identified (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berry et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Schwartz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). One possibility is that moving stimuli induce a fast decrease in the efficiency of excitatory transmission from bipolar cells to ganglion cells, shortening the time-course of excitation. This idea is attractive because bipolar cells are the only route by which excitatory signals are transmitted to ganglion cells, and these synapses have been identified as a major site of gain-control, with an increase in temporal contrast causing fast depression of vesicle release (<a href=\"#bib17\">Demb, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jarsky et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nikolaev et al., 2013</a>). A second possibility is that some mechanism intrinsic to ganglion cells alters the time-course of the ganglion cell response (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). We now need to test these various possibilities experimentally.",

The non-linear interaction between excitatory and inhibitory synapses is a result of the passive properties of the dendritic tree and remains intact when active conductances are blocked. Motion anticipation operates across most ganglion cells because it depends on general rather than specific features of the retinal connectome: independent and random distributions of excitatory and inhibitory synapses on RGCs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Freed and Sterling, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hitchcock, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kolb and Nelson, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jakobs et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Xu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Schwartz et al., 2012</a>); an excess of inhibitory inputs (<a href=\"#bib79\">West, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Koontz and Hendrickson, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Freed and Sterling, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Marshak et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hitchcock, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kolb and Nelson, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Haverkamp et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Zhu and Gibbins, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Owczarzak and Pourcho, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Marshak et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jakobs et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Koizumi et al., 2011</a>), and an average excitatory synaptic spacing along dendrites of \u223c5 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#bib20\">Freed and Sterling, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jakobs et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Xu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Koizumi et al., 2011</a>). The excess of inhibitory inputs allows tracking of all directions of motion, while the average distance between excitatory inputs determines the object velocities that can be compensated for.

The receptive field (RF) of each ganglion cell was mapped using bars flashed in a random order across the retina (<a href=\"#bib36\">Johnston et al., 2014</a>), and then a bar was flashed onto the centre of the receptive field: the delay to peak firing averaged 62 \u00b1 3 ms, largely reflecting the delay in phototransduction (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baylor and Hodgkin, 1974</a>) (n = 25; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>). But when the same bar (\u2212100% contrast; 160 \u00b5m wide, equivalent to 2.4\u00b0 of visual angle) was moved across the retina at 500 \u03bcm s<sup>\u22121</sup> (7.5\u00b0 s<sup>\u22121</sup>), the peak spike rate occurred 46 \u00b1 13 ms (n = 25) <i>before</i> the leading edge reached the receptive field centre and then activity decayed <i>before</i> the bar left (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). The time at which a RGC responded most strongly therefore encoded the anticipated position of the bar in retinotopic space (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berry et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Motion anticipation was observed across many functional types of ganglion cell, including brisk-transient, brisk-sustained and orientation selective cells. RGCs with larger RFs tended to display greater anticipation, with RF size accounting for 35% of the observed variance in the delays for motion (Pearson's r = \u22120.593, n = 25, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The three cells that failed to show any motion anticipation also had the smallest RF size.",

When this bar was presented statically for 320 ms over the RF centre, the bipolar cell input decreased rapidly after a short delay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, n = 12). This decay reflects a combination of two mechanisms controlling the output from bipolar cells: feedback inhibition from amacrine cells (<a href=\"#bib68\">Roska et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tanaka and Tachibana, 2013</a>) and depression intrinsic to the synaptic terminal, which reflects depletion of vesicles in a state ready for rapid fusion (<a href=\"#bib67\">Rieke, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Demb, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nikolaev et al., 2013</a>). To test whether these presynaptic mechanisms of gain control could generate motion anticipation in RGCs we measured the time-course of the EPSC in response to the moving bar. In 7 out of 9 RGCs the peak excitatory input was <i>delayed</i>, occurring 158 \u00b1 34 ms after the bar reached the receptive field centre (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, black trace), demonstrating that the fast gain reduction in the EPSC was not sufficient to generate motion anticipation. Further, the time-course of the EPSC induced by motion was not significantly different from the linear response predicted by convolving the dynamics of the static EPSC measured in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> with each ganglion cell's RF (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, n = 7), indicating that there was no correction at all for the lag in phototransduction.

To test the role of feedforward inhibition we measured the motion response of individual RGCs before and after the selective disruption of their inhibitory inputs. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows a RGC's spiking in response to the standard moving stimulus, recorded in cell-attached mode. As usual, firing occurred just before the leading edge reached the receptive field centre (average of 18 \u00b1 10 ms, n = 6). We then disrupted inhibition in this single ganglion cell by going into whole-cell mode and dialyzing the cell with an intracellular solution containing 120 mM Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, grey). The advantage of this approach over pharmacology or genetic manipulation is that it acutely disrupts the inhibition impinging on a <i>single</i> RGC while leaving excitatory inputs and the rest of the retinal circuitry intact; a similar approach was used to demonstrate direction selectivity occurs postsynaptically in direction-selective RGCs (<a href=\"#bib76\">Taylor et al., 2000</a>). Disrupting inhibitory inputs greatly enhanced the response to a moving bar, indicating that under normal circumstances inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub> channel does not attenuate the RGC response to motion. Importantly, with inhibition disrupted, the location of the peak firing became delayed occurring 210 \u00b1 26 ms after the stimuli had reached the RF centre (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, p &lt; 0.0002). In contrast, for the four cells tested, the delay for a flash was unaffected by disrupting inhibition (64.4 \u00b1 8.7 ms vs 62.7 \u00b1 5.2 ms, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We conclude that feedforward inhibition from amacrine cells to RGCs plays the major role in correcting for the lag in phototransduction allowing the retina to correctly signal the position of a moving object.",

The time-course of synaptic conductance changes used in simulations mimicked those measured experimentally (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), and the average density of synaptic inputs over the dendritic trees also matched known distributions with around one excitatory synapse per 5 \u00b5m of dendrite (<a href=\"#bib20\">Freed and Sterling, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jakobs et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Xu et al., 2008</a>) and a \u223c2:1 ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synapses, reflecting the ratio of the inhibitory to excitatory conductance measured over the receptive field centre (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, 2.1 \u00b1 0.23, n = 10).

To test directly whether active conductances were required to generate motion anticipation, we recorded from ganglion cells whose dendrites were made passive by dialysis of 2 mM MK-801 and 10 mM QX-314-Bromide; together these, substances block NMDA receptors and voltage-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib74\">Talbot and Sayer, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kuzmiski et al., 2010</a>). In addition to preventing any dendritic boosting of EPSPs, the somatic Na<sub>v</sub> channels were also blocked allowing us to observe the generator potential responsible for spiking. About 10 min after achieving whole-cell access we verified that the drugs had blocked voltage-gated channels by delivering a depolarizing current injection; by this time spikes were blocked and the resultant depolarization was well fit by a single exponential (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In separate experiments we found that 10 min was sufficient to completely fill the dendritic tree of ganglion cells with Alexa 488, which has a molecular weight around twice that of MK-801 and QX-314. We provided our standard moving stimulus to these passive cells and compared the motion-evoked EPSP to the expected linear response, obtained by convolution of the flash response with the measured RF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). All cells had EPSPs that peaked significantly earlier than the expected linear response (p = 0.0002, n = 7), occurring 47 \u00b1 29 ms before the stimuli reached the RF centre and this was not significantly different to the time of peak spike rate observed for the cells in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> (47 \u00b1 29 ms, n = 7 vs 46 \u00b1 13 ms, n = 25, p = 0.9844).

In a landmark theoretical study Koch et al. laid out the conditions that make inhibitory synaptic inputs most effective at counteracting excitatory inputs: (a) inhibitory inputs should be located on the path between the excitatory synapse and the soma (i.e., proximally along the dendrite), and (b) inhibitory inputs should be activated <i>before</i> the distal excitatory synapse (<a href=\"#bib37\">Koch et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Liu, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Pouille et al., 2013</a>). Satisfying these conditions depends critically on whether the object is moving towards the soma or away from it. This idea is explained further in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> where we examined the influence of a single inhibitory synapse on the ability of a single excitatory synapse to depolarize the soma. As the moving stimulus enters the receptive field an inhibitory input distal to the soma is activated first (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, left), but it fails to attenuate depolarization because it is not on the path between the excitatory synapse and the soma (condition a). If the inhibitory input is located proximal to the excitatory input, it will still be ineffective because it is activated <i>after</i> the excitatory drive has reached the soma (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, middle; condition b). Only when the stimulus is traversing the latter half of the RF does proximal inhibition occur just <i>before</i> distal excitation to \u2018cut-out\u2019 excitation reaching the soma (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, right). In this way, the peak-firing rate is brought \u2018forward\u2019 in time to compensate for the delay inherent in phototransduction.",

Motion anticipation operates for objects moving across the receptive field in any direction, so this pattern would be expected across the whole dendritic tree. Such an organization might be achieved if developmental processes cause inhibitory synapses to be placed systematically in positions proximal to the nearest excitatory synapse. Such a specific wiring rule does not, however, fit with anatomical studies, which consistently indicate that excitatory and inhibitory inputs are distributed independently and at uniform density along RGC dendrites (<a href=\"#bib20\">Freed and Sterling, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hitchcock, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kolb and Nelson, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Owczarzak and Pourcho, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jakobs et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Xu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Schwartz et al., 2012</a>).

In primate and monkey the specialized midget ganglion cell pathway has RF smaller than those presented here, consequently they may not exhibit motion anticipation. Indeed, measurements of synapse ratios obtained from electronmicroscopy of parafoveal RGCs in monkey and human indicate that some of these small RGCs have I/E ratios of \u223c1:1 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kolb and Dekorver, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Calkins et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Calkins and Sterling, 2007</a>), which would further diminish their ability to perform motion anticipation. This observation may make sense in the framework of separate \u2018what\u2019 and \u2018where\u2019 visual pathways (<a href=\"#bib23\">Goodale and Milner, 1992</a>); ganglion cells with the smallest RFs, such as the midget or parvocellular (P) pathway, are involved in coding object detail and correspondingly have the highest spatial resolution but slowest conduction velocities (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gouras, 1969</a>). Whereas RGCs with larger RFs, the magnocellular (M) pathway, have high conduction velocities (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gouras, 1969</a>) and are involved in coding the spatial location of an object relative to the organism, a computation that would obviously benefit from motion anticipation. For the RGCs involved in the \u2018where\u2019 pathway, three general properties of the retinal connectome that give rise to motion anticipation are observed across a wide variety of species: an excess of inhibitory over excitatory inputs, a constant density of these inputs and their random distribution over the whole dendritic tree (<a href=\"#bib79\">West, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Koontz and Hendrickson, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Freed and Sterling, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Marshak et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hitchcock, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kolb and Nelson, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Weber and Stanford, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Haverkamp et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Zhu and Gibbins, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Owczarzak and Pourcho, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Marshak et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jakobs et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Koizumi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Schwartz et al., 2012</a>). The generality of these conditions across species underlines the fundamental importance of correcting for the phototransduction delay so that retinotopic mapping can be conserved when encoding the position of a moving object.

A priori reasoning also suggests that motion anticipation should be autonomous to each ganglion cell, rather than occurring earlier in the retinal circuitry. Consider a single bipolar cell situated between, and contacting two ganglion cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Asari and Meister, 2012</a>). For a stimulus traversing the retina this bipolar cell will drive one ganglion cell at its latter edge and the second ganglion cell at its initial edge. If the gain of this bipolar cell were reduced for the first ganglion cell it would also retard the second cell's ability to respond to the same stimulus. In effect the neural image on the retina would fade as the stimulus moved across visual space. Instead, motion anticipation is generated by passive interactions within the ganglion cell dendritic tree, and is therefore relatively independent of other computations carried out by the circuitry of the inner retina. It is the non-linear interaction of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs within the dendritic tree that shifts the profile of excitation forward in time. Simulations indicate that the density of synaptic inputs along dendrites determines the object velocities that can be corrected.",

The modelling we carried out as part of this study illustrates why the classical linear-nonlinear receptive field model incompletely describes the response of a ganglion cell to a moving stimulus: excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs interact in a non-linear manner that depends on time and position on the dendritic tree. <a href=\"#bib37\">Koch et al., 1983</a> have described the shunting effect of an inhibitory input lying on the path between an excitatory input and the soma as an analogue implementation of a Boolean AND-NOT operation in which one input vetoes another.

There are, however, at least 22 different types of amacrine cell (<a href=\"#bib50\">MacNeil and Masland, 1998</a>), but we understand little about the specific response properties of these and even less about how the different types are connected to ganglion cell dendrites. The few notable exceptions highlight the sophistication that can be achieved. For example a combination of intrinsic (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hausselt et al., 2007</a>) and synaptic (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lee and Zhou, 2006</a>) mechanisms endow individual dendrites of starburst amacrine cells with a directional preference for moving stimuli. Our model demonstrates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) that the location of an inhibitory synapse on the dendritic tree of a ganglion cell can have a large effect on the output of that ganglion cell. Indeed the operation of direction-selective ganglion cells results from the particular wiring of their starburst amacrine cell inputs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Briggman et al., 2011</a>). It is therefore expected that a proportion of the inhibitory inputs impinging on ganglion cells may already represent complex transformations of the visual signal.",

We encountered two orientation-selective cells but no direction-selective cells. The orientation selective cells responded strongly to a moving bar in their preferred orientation and failed to spike to a bar orthogonal to this axis.",

The electrical properties used throughout the manuscript were: intracellular resistance (Ri) = 180 \u03a9.cm, membrane capacitance (Cm) = 1 \u00b5F cm<sup>\u22122</sup> and membrane resistance (Rm) = 20 M\u03a9 cm<sup>\u22122</sup>, however, we found that these parameters were not critical for the appearance of motion anticipation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The dendrites of the retinal ganglion cells traversed a virtual inner plexiform layer that was populated with excitatory bipolar and inhibitory amacrine synapses using the \u2018cubic close packed cell packing adaptor\u2019 in neuroConstruct. Bipolar terminals were packed with an effective radius of 5.1 \u00b5m and amacrine cells with an effective radius of 4 \u00b5m. We set connections between synapses and the dendritic tree of each RGC using morphology based connections. Searches for a connection between each synaptic terminal and a target dendrite were completely random with a distance constraint of 10 \u00b5m, 300 attempts were initiated for each synapse. This gave a density of 0.182, 0.303 and 0.189 excitatory synaptic contacts \u00b5m<sup>\u22121</sup> of dendrite for RGC1, 2 and 3 respectively, which is close to the observed density (<a href=\"#bib20\">Freed and Sterling, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jakobs et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Xu et al., 2008</a>). The density of inhibitory synapses was 0.426, 0.606 and 0.459 synapses \u00b5m<sup>\u22121</sup> of dendrite for each RGC, this higher density of inhibitory contacts is a conservative estimate of the number of inhibitory contacts seen with electron microscopy which can be as high as five times the number of excitatory contacts (<a href=\"#bib20\">Freed and Sterling, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hitchcock, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kolb and Nelson, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Owczarzak and Pourcho, 1999</a>). Each synapse was modeled as a point process, and the time-course of the currents were described by three piecewise functions obtained by fits to the measured synaptic conductances (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The three piecewise functions correspond to the onset of the steady state phase (a), the decay after the stimulus (b) and the adaptation to the stimulus over the steady state phase (c). The synaptic conductance was G(t) = m \u00d7 (a + b \u2212 c) where m is a scaling factor. For the excitatory conductance:",

                    "text": "Motion anticipation allows the visual system to compensate for the slow speed of phototransduction so that a moving object can be accurately located. This correction is already present in the signal that ganglion cells send from the retina but the biophysical mechanisms underlying this computation are not known. Here we demonstrate that motion anticipation is computed autonomously within the dendritic tree of each ganglion cell and relies on feedforward inhibition. The passive and non-linear interaction of excitatory and inhibitory synapses enables the somatic voltage to encode the actual position of a moving object instead of its delayed representation. General rather than specific features of the retinal connectome govern this computation: an excess of inhibitory inputs over excitatory, with both being randomly distributed, allows tracking of all directions of motion, while the average distance between inputs determines the object velocities that can be compensated for.",

This is about the same time it takes a tennis ball to travel several meters during a tennis match, yet we are still able to see where the moving tennis ball is in real time. This is because a process called \u2018motion anticipation\u2019 is able to compensate for the delay in processing the position of a moving object. However, it was not known precisely how motion anticipation occurs.",

Each cell receives signals from several photoreceptors, which each connect to a different site along branch-like structures called dendrites that project out of the retinal ganglion cells.",

This revealed inhibitory signals, sent from photoreceptors to retinal ganglion cells via a type of intermediate cell (called amacrine cells), play a key role in motion anticipation. The ability to track motion effectively in all directions requires more inhibitory signals to be sent to the dendrites of a retinal ganglion cell than excitatory signals. These two types of input must also be randomly distributed across the cell. Furthermore, it is the density of these input sites on a dendrite that determines how well the retina can compensate for the motion of a fast-moving object. The building blocks required for motion anticipation in the retina are also found in visual areas higher in the brain. Therefore, further work may reveal that higher visual areas also use this mechanism to predict the future location of moving objects.",

Motion anticipation, therefore, can result from randomly distributed synapses as long as inhibitory synapses outnumber excitatory by about 2-to-1. Such conditions are met on many RGC dendrites (although see observation below) and might well be observed in other parts of the brain, making this biophysical mechanism potentially quite general. More generally, this study makes a compelling case that feedforward inhibition plays a major role in motion anticipation.",

They show that parasol and midget RGCs across a wide range of eccentricities have a 1:1 ratio of inhibition to excitation. Several studies from old world monkeys by Calkins, Sterling, Marshak, and Kolb indicate that inhibitory synapses in the peripheral retina outnumber excitatory synapses, but that the opposite is true in the central retina. Studies of bistratified RGCs in the monkey suggest that the proportion of excitatory and inhibitory synapses depends on dendritic strata. Thus the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory synapses depends on species, ganglion cell type, and retinal location.",

Also, the authors show a large range of I:E ratios in different RGCs. Does the ratio of I:E correlate with the amount of motion anticipation, with low ratios exhibiting less anticipation? This seems straightforward to test on a cell by cell basis and would help to relate inhibition directly motion anticipation rather than by the process of elimination.",

The authors motivate their study by the important contribution the retina makes to the behavioral phenomenon of motion anticipation. However, without knowing the size of a goldfish eye, one cannot relate any of the speeds they probed experimentally to the speed of objects in the environment. The findings in this study could be more relevant to a general readership if this relationship is made explicit and speeds are quoted in units of degrees of visual angle per second. Related, it seems important to note that this will depend on the size of the animal's eye. Thus, given an equivalent amount of motion anticipation per RGC in a small eye compared to a large eye, there will be very different amounts of motion anticipation at the level of the retina. This seems worth noting in the Discussion.",

The literature, however, does not seem to substantiate this claim. For instance the recent paper by Abbott et al., (2012) from the laboratories of Grunert and Martin working on the marmoset retina. They show that parasol and midget RGCs across a wide range of eccentricities have a 1:1 ratio of inhibition to excitation. Several studies from old world monkeys by Calkins, Sterling, Marshak, and Kolb indicate that inhibitory synapses in the peripheral retina outnumber excitatory synapses, but that the opposite is true in the central retina. Studies of bistratified RGCs in the monkey suggest that the proportion of excitatory and inhibitory synapses depends on dendritic strata. Thus the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory synapses depends on species, ganglion cell type, and retinal location.</i>",

This seems important to determine to validate their analysis and conclusions. The authors show that the ratio of inhibition to excitation functionally is about 2:1, but doesn't synapse position/number also matter? Also, the authors show a large range of I:E ratios in different RGCs. Does the ratio of I:E correlate with the amount of motion anticipation, with low ratios exhibiting less anticipation? This seems straightforward to test on a cell by cell basis and would help to relate inhibition directly motion anticipation rather than by the process of elimination.</i>",

The authors motivate their study by the important contribution the retina makes to the behavioral phenomenon of motion anticipation. However, without knowing the size of a goldfish eye, one cannot relate any of the speeds they probed experimentally to the speed of objects in the environment. The findings in this study could be more relevant to a general readership if this relationship is made explicit and speeds are quoted in units of degrees of visual angle per second. Related, it seems important to note that this will depend on the size of the animal's eye. Thus, given an equivalent amount of motion anticipation per RGC in a small eye compared to a large eye, there will be very different amounts of motion anticipation at the level of the retina.
