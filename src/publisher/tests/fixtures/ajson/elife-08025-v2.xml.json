The most abundant ganglion cell type in mice, the so-called W3 ganglion cell, selectively responds to movements of small objects. Where and how object motion sensitivity arises in the retina is incompletely understood. In this study, we use 2-photon-guided patch-clamp recordings to characterize responses of vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGluT3)-expressing amacrine cells (ACs) to a broad set of visual stimuli. We find that these ACs are object motion sensitive and analyze the synaptic mechanisms underlying this computation. Anatomical circuit reconstructions suggest that VGluT3-expressing ACs form glutamatergic synapses with W3 ganglion cells, and targeted recordings show that the tuning of W3 ganglion cells' excitatory input matches that of VGluT3-expressing ACs' responses. Synaptic excitation of W3 ganglion cells is diminished, and responses to object motion are suppressed in mice lacking VGluT3. Object motion, thus, is first detected by VGluT3-expressing ACs, which provide feature-selective excitatory input to W3 ganglion cells.",

The most abundant RGC type in the mouse retina (W3-RGC) was recently shown to respond selectively to movements of small\u2014in terms of size on the retina\u2014objects (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). Detecting object motion is a challenging task as head, body, and eye movements frequently shift the retinal image (<a href=\"#bib30\">Martinez-Conde et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sakatani and Isa, 2007</a>). To distinguish movements of objects and the background, object motion sensitive (OMS) RGCs respond to differences in the timing of texture movements in their receptive field center and surround (<a href=\"#bib37\">Olveczky et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). W3-RGCs share key properties with OMS RGCs in rabbit and salamander, but, due to stronger surround suppression, do not respond at the border of larger objects (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). This feature is reminiscent of local-edge-detector RGCs described in several species (<a href=\"#bib27\">Levick, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zeck et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Roska et al., 2006</a>). W3-RGCs, thus, appear to be in the intersection of OMS and local-edge-detector RGCs. Although postsynaptic inhibition and spike thresholds sharpen the tuning of W3-RGCs, similar to other OMS and local-edge-detector RGCs, key response properties appear to be inherited from their excitatory input (<a href=\"#bib47\">van Wyk et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Baccus et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Russell and Werblin, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>).

ACs are the most diverse class of neurons in the retina, encompassing 30\u201350 cell types (<a href=\"#bib28\">MacNeil and Masland, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</a>) that serve task-specific functions in vision (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dacheux and Raviola, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Yoshida et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Euler et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Munch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Grimes et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen and Li, 2012</a>). Although most ACs release \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine, a wide range of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators can be found in different cell types including one expressing the vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGluT3) (gene: <i>Slc17a8</i>, protein: VGluT3, AC: VG3) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fyk-Kolodziej et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Haverkamp and Wassle, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Johnson et al., 2004</a>). VG3-ACs are conserved from rodents to primates. Recent studies found that VG3-ACs respond to light increments (ON) and decrements (OFF) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grimes et al., 2011</a>), show strong surround suppression, and following optogenetic or electrical stimulation can release glutamate (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2014</a>).

Using biolistics, we show that many excitatory synapses on W3-RGCs are apposed by boutons of VG3-ACs, and in whole-cell recordings from W3-RGCs, find that properties of their excitatory input match VG3-AC responses.

After tamoxifen injection, a subset of VG3-ACs expresses tdTomato in <i>VG3-CreERT2 Ai9</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Neurites of VG3-ACs stratify broadly in the center of the inner plexiform layer (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grimes et al., 2011</a>), occupy medium-sized lateral territories (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, 7662 \u00b1 211 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>, n = 39), and as a population, cover the retina approximately seven times (coverage: 6.88). To characterize light responses, we obtained <i>VG3-Cre</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grimes et al., 2011</a>) in which all VG3-ACs express Cre (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), crossed them to <i>Ai9</i>, and targeted fluorescent somata in the inner nuclear layer (INL) for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Consistent with previous results, we find that VG3-ACs respond transiently to light increments and decrements, depolarizing to small and hyperpolarizing to large stimuli (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that this switch in response polarity is caused by a combination of pre- and post-synaptic surround inhibition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). Excitatory and voltage-response receptive fields are well fit by Difference-of-Gaussians models (<a href=\"#bib9\">Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">McMahon et al., 2004</a>), whereas a single Gaussian is sufficient to describe the monotonic rise of inhibition with stimulus size. For all components, OFF responses exceed ON responses, and for voltage responses and excitatory inputs, ON receptive fields are larger in diameter than their OFF counterparts. We characterized the temporal tuning of VG3-AC responses and underlying synaptic inputs in more detail using white noise stimuli (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).",

Furthermore, bipolar cells with transient responses stratify near the center of the IPL (i.e., <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), whereas axons of bipolar cells with sustained responses stratify closer to its borders (<a href=\"#bib40\">Roska and Werblin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baden et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Borghuis et al., 2013</a>). Finally, a recent study identified gradients in the linearity of glutamate release across the IPL with more rectified bipolar cells stratifying towards the middle (<a href=\"#bib4\">Borghuis et al., 2013</a>). Stratification in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, thus, positions VG3-ACs ideally to recruit input from transient rectified ON and OFF bipolar cells, as well as to form synapses with dendrites of W3-RGCs.

Third order neurons that receive convergent rectified input from bipolar cells can detect motion and other changes in patterns with structure on the scale of bipolar cells' receptive fields even when the average luminance across their own receptive fields does not change (i.e., nonlinear spatial integration) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Victor and Shapley, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Demb et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schwartz et al., 2012</a>). To evaluate input rectification of VG3-ACs, we presented sinusoidally modulated split-field stimuli in which the receptive field center was divided evenly or in a biased manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). We then compared the power of excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) responses at once (F1) and twice (F2) the frequency of modulation (2 Hz, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H,I</a>). Excitatory input to biased split-field stimuli is modulated primarily at the stimulus frequency and recapitulates the OFF-preference of VG3-ACs. The F2-dominant responses to even split-field stimulation indicate that this excitatory input is provided by rectified bipolar cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grimes et al., 2014</a>). To test whether inhibition, like excitation, is driven by rectified receptive field subunits and to measure their spatial extent, we sinusoidally modulated square-wave gratings with different bar widths in an annular region overlaying the receptive field surround (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) show frequency-doubled (F2) responses characteristic of rectified input (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K,L</a>). F2 power increases in a step-like fashion between bar widths of 25 \u03bcm and 50 \u03bcm, suggesting that bipolar cells are likely the cellular substrate for nonlinear subunits (<a href=\"#bib48\">Victor and Shapley, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Demb et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schwartz et al., 2012</a>).

Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that this response pattern is caused by preferential excitation during center-only motion and strong inhibition elicited whenever motion includes the surround (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E,D</a>). Since the average luminance in center and surround regions does not change in this stimulus, the observed responses provide further evidence that both are composed of rectified subunits, allowing VG3-ACs to detect when an object moves at a different time than the background irrespective of the precise spatial patterns involved, a defining feature of OMS neurons (<a href=\"#bib37\">Olveczky et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Baccus et al., 2008</a>).",

Narrow dark bars moving across the receptive fields of VG3-ACs elicited transient depolarizations as leading and trailing edges cross the receptive field center. Robust edge responses were observed over a wide range of motion speeds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>) and were indistinguishable for leading and trailing edges in spite of the opposite polarity of the associated temporal contrast. Responses of VG3-ACs are not directionally selective (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar to voltage recordings, transient EPSCs and IPSCs were observed during edge transits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). EPSCs and IPSCs were larger at leading than trailing edges and showed a preference for the faster speeds tested (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). However, the ratio of excitation and inhibition remained relatively constant across these conditions, which likely accounts for the greater constancy of edge responses observed in voltage recordings. Local edge detectors are typically stimulated robustly by narrow contrast edges, but not by expansive ones (<a href=\"#bib27\">Levick, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Roska and Werblin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zeck et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">van Wyk et al., 2006</a>). We, therefore, recorded responses of VG3-ACs to bars of varying heights moving across their receptive field at a constant speed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). Edge responses were strongly suppressed for bar heights above 200 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L,M</a>). Trailing edge responses to the smallest bars were lower than leading edge responses, likely a consequence of the asymmetric size of VG3-ACs' ON and OFF receptive field centers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Similar to voltage responses, excitatory synaptic inputs showed edge response suppression for larger stimuli, whereas inhibition rose and plateaued with increasing bar height (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2N,O</a>), corroborating that surround inhibition acts both pre- and post-synaptic in VG3-ACs. VG3-ACs, thus, show key response features of OMS and local-edge-detector neurons, and through the synaptic mechanisms outlined above, selectively detect movements of small objects.",

Surround suppression of the excitatory input to W3-RGCs was found to rely on spiking ACs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). To test whether surround suppression of VG3-ACs is similarly mediated by spiking ACs and to assess its importance to feature detection, we tested the effect of the sodium channel blocker TTX on VG3-ACs' responses in differential motion and edge detection stimulus paradigms. In the presence of TTX, VG3-ACs depolarized to global motion as well as differential center motion, and hyperpolarizations observed during surround stimulation were abolished (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Edge responses elicited by narrow bars moving across the receptive fields of VG3-ACs at a variety of speeds were not changed by TTX (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), but the suppression observed for larger bars was blocked (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Surround inhibition, thus, is critical for the feature detection of VG3-ACs and appears to be mediated by spiking ACs. The use of spikes to signal surround motion likely improves temporal coincidence of inhibitory input with bipolar cell depolarization and excitatory input to VG3-ACs during coherent motion, leading to more effective cancellation of center signals by the surround.",

Removal of VGluT3, which in the retina is only expressed by VG3-ACs, affected neither gross morphological development of the retina (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) nor dendritic patterns of W3-RGCs (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

In agreement with anatomical results (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), VG3-ACs, thus, appear to provide approximately half of the excitatory input to W3-RGCs.

Multi-tiered inhibition combined with delayed excitation, and successive threshold nonlinearities likely contribute to sharpening. Surround inhibition acts at three levels: bipolar axon terminals, VG3-ACs, and W3-RGCs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). Key features\u2014transient ON and OFF input driven by rectified subunits\u2014are similar at all three stages, arguing that inhibition is provided by a single AC type or a shared set of AC types, which remain to be identified. The added level of inhibition onto VG3-ACs compared to conventional pathways through bipolar cells likely contributes to the more complete surround suppression in the OMS circuit. Moreover, channeling of excitation through VG3-ACs introduces a delay not shared by the inhibitory input, which could improve cancellation of center signals by the surround, for example, during global image motion. The sequential arrangement of three thresholding nonlinearities\u2014glutamate release from bipolar cells, glutamate release from VG3-ACs, and spike generation in W3-RGCs\u2014likely further contributes to the increasing selectivity for narrow vs broad edges and differential center vs global texture motion at successive stages of the OMS circuit. Finally, our results support the notion that the diversity of AC types and circuit motifs in which they participate are integral to the diversity of features encoded in the signals the retinal sends to the brain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Masland, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jadzinsky and Baccus, 2013</a>).",

Circles of different size were presented in different pseudorandom sequences for each cell, and the first stimulus in the sequence repeated at its end to confirm stability of the recording. Temporal response functions and filter properties were analyzed using Gaussian white noise stimulation in which the intensity of a circular region over the receptive field center (voltage, excitation) or an annular region covering its surround (inhibition) was chosen at random from a normal distribution (RMS contrast: 40%) and updated at 30 Hz for 10 min.

To estimate spatial receptive field parameters, we fit Difference-of-Gaussians (voltage, excitation) or single Gaussian (inhibition) models to area response data (<a href=\"#bib9\">Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">McMahon et al., 2004</a>). Receptive field sizes were measured as the diameter of the respective Gaussians at 1 SD. To analyze of VG3-ACs, we recovered separate ON and OFF filters from responses to Gaussian white noise stimulation. First, overlapping stimulus segments were weighted by their ensuing baseline-subtracted response (voltage or conductance) to compute the response-weighted stimulus ensemble, analogous to the spike-triggered stimulus ensemble frequently used in the characterization of RGC responses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chichilnisky, 2001</a>). We then identified the dimension of highest variance in the response-weighted stimulus ensemble by principle components analysis and separated response-weighted stimulus segments in two groups based on their projection onto this first principle component (positive = ON, negative = OFF). ON and OFF segments were averaged to determine ON and OFF filters, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The amplitudes of these linear filters were scaled such that their sum equaled the sum of the global response-weighted stimulus average. Similar procedures have previously been used to analyze the contributions of ON and OFF pathways to RGC spike trains (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fairhall et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Greschner et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gollisch and Meister, 2008</a>). To summarize temporal frequency tuning and sensitivity across several cells, Fourier amplitudes of ON and OFF filters were calculated. To characterize spatial integration, Fourier amplitudes of responses at once (F1, 2 Hz) and twice (F2, 4 Hz) the frequencies of sine wave modulation of contrast-reversing square-wave gratings over the receptive field center (excitation) or surround (inhibition) were analyzed. Edge detection tuning was measured from response amplitudes as leading and trailing edges of dark or bright bars of different heights moving at a variety of speeds crossed the receptive field center. Similarly, response amplitudes during selective (center or surround) or global (center and surround) luminance-neutral motion stimuli were compared to reveal differential motion sensitivity.",

W3-RGCs) expressed CFP and PSD95-YFP following biolistic transfection. Using local thresholding W3-RGC dendrites, PSD95 puncta and VG3-AC neurites were masked separately in Amira (FEI Company). Excitatory synapses on W3-RGCs formed by VG3-ACs were defined as PSD95 clusters with a center of mass within 0.5 \u03bcm from a VG3-AC neurite. We confirmed that varying this distance from 0.25 to 1 \u03bcm did not qualitatively change the results. Given the size of synaptic puncta, this range implies overlap or direct apposition of signals from PSD95-YFP and tdTomato in VG3 neurites. To compare the input fraction (i.e., fraction of PSD95 puncta apposed by a VG3 neurite) to chance levels, positions of PSD95 puncta were randomized within the synaptic layer in Monte Carlo simulations. Territories occupied by neurites of VG3-ACs and dendrites of W3-RGCs were measured by the area of the smallest convex polygon to encompass the respective arbors in a z-axis projection of image stacks acquired in flat-mounted retinas.

The most abundant ganglion cell type in mice, the so-called W3 ganglion cell, selectively responds to movements of small objects. Where and how object motion sensitivity arises in the retina is incompletely understood. In this study, we use 2-photon-guided patch-clamp recordings to characterize responses of vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGluT3)-expressing amacrine cells (ACs) to a broad set of visual stimuli. We find that these ACs are object motion sensitive and analyze the synaptic mechanisms underlying this computation. Anatomical circuit reconstructions suggest that VGluT3-expressing ACs form glutamatergic synapses with W3 ganglion cells, and targeted recordings show that the tuning of W3 ganglion cells' excitatory input matches that of VGluT3-expressing ACs' responses. Synaptic excitation of W3 ganglion cells is diminished, and responses to object motion are suppressed in mice lacking VGluT3. Object motion, thus, is first detected by VGluT3-expressing ACs, which provide feature-selective excitatory input to W3 ganglion cells.",
